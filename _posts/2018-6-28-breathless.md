she looks at me with expectant eyes
as if to ask

no words come out

...

what do I say?

do you remember when I sank that cup and won the game and
your arm grazed my shoulder in felicity
transferring static electricity
we celebrated the celebration
the moment of college consummation

No, you would not remember and just say no and look at me funny

it's been so long; you thought you were above me before.  
I loved you, though, in the brief moments we felt

before you brushed me off

  
No, I can't say that, filter it out

  
but now the eyes, the beautiful brown eyes stare longingly, lovingly, waiting  
crestfallen, I notice you drop with disinterest, with sadness;

I offer a stock question.

In transmission the void saps all feeling, incinerates the inward  
emotion

oh what cities of wonder lost, what atlantises forever submerged
by the vacuum, that medium between body and soul.

  
the emotionless, stock question, the straight face, the robotic delivery
inspires nothing.

you answer as best you can; nothing begets nothing.

and silence

  
what to say

  
looks forward focusing blankly
wheels spinning

what to say

brow furrowed, breathing intently

you look so sad; please -- you tell me -- help me, please say something

  
I tell myself, please say something

the mind's chamber breaks,

the void crushes the delicate casing; sucking it in
substance rushing out, soul rushing out

each thought gripping tightly, futilly,
like the last fingers to the remnants of the  
collapsing structure

before the black hole yanks them

before the void suffocates the soul

drains all cognition




I look forward empty, stupidly


please say something
