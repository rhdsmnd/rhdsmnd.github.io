she looks at me with expectant eyes<br>
as if to ask

no words come out

...

what do I say?

do you remember when I sank that cup and won the game and<br>
your arm grazed my shoulder in felicity<br>
transferring static electricity<br>
we celebrated the celebration<br>
the moment of college consummation

No, you would not remember and just say no and look at me funny

it's been so long; you thought you were above me before.<br>
I loved you, though, in the brief moments we felt

before you brushed me off

<br>
No, I can't say that, filter it out

<br>
but now the eyes, the beautiful brown eyes stare longingly, lovingly, waiting<br>
crestfallen, I notice you drop with disinterest, with sadness;

I offer a stock question.

In transmission the void saps all feeling, incinerates the inward<br>
emotion

oh what cities of wonder lost, what atlantises forever<br>
submerged by the vacuum, that<br>
medium between body and soul.

<br>
the emotionless, stock question, the straight face, the robotic delivery<br>
inspires nothing.

you answer as best you can; nothing begets nothing.

and silence

<br>
what to say

<br>
looks forward focusing blankly<br>
wheels spinning

what to say

brow furrowed, breathing intently

you look so sad; please -- you tell me -- help me, please say something

<br>
I tell myself, please say something

the mind's chamber breaks,

the void crushes the delicate casing; sucking it in<br>
substance rushing out, soul rushing out

each thought gripping tightly, futilly,<br>
like the last fingers to the remnants of the<br>
collapsing structure

before the black hole yanks them

before the void suffocates the soul

drains all cognition

<br>
<br>
<br>
I look forward empty, stupidly

<br>
please say something
