She may look like any other<br>
To the unnoticed eye<br>
With the same pretty parts<br>
Two legs with two pedals<br>
Two arms with two bars<br>
Though you wouldn’t know<br>
Her look by her name.<br>
<br>
Pure black, the frame coated<br>
With its staid demeanor and<br>
Rebellious heart, defiant<br>
But beautifully still, held<br>
Fixed against the whirring<br>
Silver of spokes and gears<br>
Not a speck of its namesake red<br>
Which, like rust, would only<br>
Adulterate its clean beauty.<br>
<br>
Note dear reader the lack of ‘unity’ for<br>
Silver and black,<br>
For stirring and steadfastness,<br>
A jealous Husband<br>
Reserves the title<br>
Only for him and her.<br>
<br>
His first touch over the metal mane<br>
Cold from the cruelty, my neglect.<br>
All sadness dispersed with one bounding<br>
Hop over the back and onto the saddle<br>
Readjusting, finding the familiar<br>
Position, seat low to dig deep into<br>
The pedal, breaks squeezed bite<br>
At the midpoint, not immovable<br>
Nor empty.  Clicking sound as<br>
The foot massages the crank<br>
Backwards effortlessly.<br>
<br>
With preparations set, right leg<br>
At 1 o’clock, ready for the downstroke<br>
The human footstand now leaps lightly<br>
Onto the other circular step.<br>
<br>
If these details do bore,<br>
Then what sadness I have<br>
To not impart that true love<br>
Which enlivens the mundane,<br>
Paces the heart like mine<br>
In the first moments of our<br>
Momentous reunion.<br>
<br>
These moments I ache for, and many more<br>
<br>
--<br>
Roaring down the Powell Street corridor<br>
--<br>
Bending space and time<br>
Past the vehicles in line<br>
--<br>
<br>
Helmets of mistrust, we would scorn,<br>
Others look with jealous forlorn<br>
<br>
But in perfect safety we lived,<br>
Psychic understanding only she<br>
Knew; with it we slanted the<br>
Center of gravity itself,<br>
Holding each other safe, forsaking<br>
The ground beneath our intertwined feet.<br>
<br>
The gifts I brought -- new grease,<br>
New wheels, new chain --<br>
Repaid always with fresh<br>
Enthusiasm, renewed<br>
our vows to each other,<br>
The lovebirds enjoyed<br>
In the ensuing rides<br>
The honeymoon which recalled<br>
Them to each other, and to<br>
The first time they met.<br>
<br>
Oh God curse my foolish foolishness!<br>
My careless neglect, she outside<br>
The whole night, enduring the cold,<br>
The loneliness, locked against a pole<br>
Like a dog -- I can’t utter the other<br>
Word, the awful truth -- with a careless<br>
Owner.  She so divine, treated so low<br>
Deserved so more, and so with<br>
Heaven and order inverted<br>
In that local kingdom, then true<br>
Heaven and order inverted<br>
Heaven’s natural lease<br>
(oh what joy old age would have brought!),<br>
And moved swiftly, silently, fatally.<br>
<br>
All that was left were the broken<br>
Pieces of a metal far less pure<br>
Than the one it guarded, that last shameful<br>
Irony cut the psyche like heaven<br>
The lock, and I did wander on foot<br>
Alone, with only my mistakes,<br>
My cruelties, and my idiocies.<br>
<br>
So ends, like so many<br>
Others, the woeful tale<br>
Of my first true love.<br>
