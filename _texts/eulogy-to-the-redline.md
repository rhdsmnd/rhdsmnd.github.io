She may look like any other<br>
To the unnoticed eye<br>
With the same pretty parts:<br>
Two pedals for feet<br>
Two handles for hands.<br>
Though you wouldn’t know<br>
Her look by her name.<br>
<br>
Pure black, frame coated<br>
With staid defiance<br>
'Gainst the whirring<br>
Silver of spokes and gears.<br>
Not a speck of namesake red<br>
To rust its beauty.<br>
<br>
After the first look comes his first touch<br>
The metal mane cold from my cruel neglect.<br>
All sadness dispersed with one bounding<br>
Hop over the back and onto the saddle<br>
<br>
Readjusting,<br>
he finds the familiar position;<br>
Seat low to dig deep into the pedal.<br>
Breaks squeezed;<br>
They bite at the midpoint,<br>
Not immovable nor empty.<br>
Clicking sound as the foot massages<br>
The crank backwards effortlessly.<br>
<br>
With the right leg ready at 1 o’clock<br>
For the downstroke,<br>
The left leaps lightly<br>
Onto the other circular step.<br>
<br>
If these details do bore,<br>
Then what sadness I have<br>
To not impart that true love<br>
Which enlivens the mundane,<br>
Paces the heart like mine<br>
In the first moments of our<br>
Momentous reunion.<br>
<br>
These moments I ache for, and many more<br>
<br>
--<br>
Roaring down the Powell Street corridor<br>
--<br>
Bending space and time<br>
Past the vehicles in line<br>
--<br>
<br>
Helmets of mistrust, we would scorn,<br>
Others look with jealous forlorn<br>
<br>
But in perfect safety we lived,<br>
Psychic understanding only she<br>
Knew; with it we slanted the<br>
Center of gravity itself,<br>
Holding each other safe, forsaking<br>
The ground beneath our intertwined feet.<br>
<br>
The gifts I brought -- new grease,<br>
New wheels, new chain --<br>
Repaid always with fresh<br>
Enthusiasm, renewed<br>
our vows to each other,<br>
The lovebirds enjoyed<br>
In the ensuing rides<br>
The honeymoon which recalled them<br>
To the first time they met.<br>
<br>
Oh God curse my foolish foolishness!<br>
My careless neglect, she outside<br>
The whole night, enduring the cold,<br>
The loneliness, locked against a pole<br>
Like a dog -- the awful truth!  -- <br>
With a careless owner.<br>
She so divine, treated so low<br>
Deserved so much more, and so with<br>
Heaven and order inverted<br>
In that local kingdom, then true<br>
Heaven and order inverted<br>
Heaven’s natural lease,<br>
(oh what joy old age would have brought!),<br>
And moved swiftly, silently, fatally.<br>
<br>
All that was left were the broken<br>
Pieces of a metal far less pure<br>
Than the one it guarded, that last shameful<br>
Irony cut the psyche like heaven<br>
The lock, and I did wander on foot<br>
Alone, with only my mistakes,<br>
My cruelties, and my idiocies.<br>
<br>
So ends, like so many<br>
Others, the woeful tale<br>
Of my first true love.<br>
