The shrouded fog clouded his mind<br>
fire burning from his soul  <br>
she grazed his arm.. he her back<br>
<br>
And all matter melted<br>
Off script, off-kilter<br>
they strayed<br>

Dangerous territory unmarked<br>
Paths never trodden<br>
Stumbling forward they walked,<br>

<br>he catching her<br>
she catching him<br><br>

laughing, wandering<br>
exploring playfully the contour<br>
as she laid back<br>

To feel his touch<br>
<br>
Arching, twitching, relenting<br>
to the tips of his fingers, where she<br>
in response traced the arm<br>
'cross the plain, elbow to wrist<br>
lightly, pleasantly, his arm hair<br>
tingling in<br><br>
rapturous<br><br>
sensation<br>
<br>
Words covered their pleasure<br>
Easily and they let speech gracefully<br>
Work its burueaucratic purpose, the<br>
Formality cloaking them in comfort<br>
<br>
Till another intruded:<br>
With watching eyes audited<br>
Like a searchlight each movement<br>
Of the two confidants and<br>
By democratic and rational process<br>
Vetoed the motion,<br>
The wonder, and the possibility.<br>
<br>
How quick the flighty moment had passed!<br>
Divinely ordained and as divinely revoked<br>
Left them bare, empty, uninspired;<br>
Yet the piece, by divine memory<br>
Graciously given, entered<br>
The ethereal portal of his mind.<br>

Within that great expanse that one<br>
Secret brightened one part of the otherwise<br>
Infinitely dark universe.<br>
