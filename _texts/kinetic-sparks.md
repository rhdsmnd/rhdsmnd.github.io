The shrouded fog clouded his mind<br>
The fiery engine drove from the piston<br>
She grazed his arm as he her back<br>
<br>
And then all concentrated matter melted<br>
Off script and off-kilter they strayed<br>
Dangerous territory unmarked, paths never trodden<br>
Stumbling forward they walked, he catching her<br>
She catching him - laughing, wandering<br>
Exploring playfully the contour<br>
Which so wonderf'ly laid back<br>
To feel his touch<br>
<br>
Arching, twitching, relenting<br>
To the tips of his fingers, where she<br>
In response traced the arm<br>
'cross the plain, elbow to wrist<br>
Lightly, pleasantly, his arm hair<br>
Tingling in rapturous sensation<br>
<br>
Words covered their pleasure<br>
Easily, and they let speech gracefully<br>
Work its burueaucratic purpose, the<br>
Formality cloaking them in comfort<br>
<br>
Till a friend intruded:<br>
With watching eyes audited<br>
Like a searchlight each movement<br>
Of the two confidants and<br>
By democratic process vetoed the<br>
Motion, wonder, and possibility.<br>
<br>
Oh how quick the flighty moment had passed!<br>
Divinely ordained and as divinely revoked<br>
Left them bare, empty, ininspired<br>
Yet the piece, by divine memory<br>
So graciously given, lay lovingly<br>
At the other end of the ethereal<br>
Portal.  Within that great expanse that one<br>
Secret brightened one part of the otherwise<br>
Infinitely dark universe.<br>
