she looks at me with expectant eyes<br>
as if to ask

no words come out

...

what do I say?

do you remember when I sank the cup and won the game<br>
your arm grazed my shoulder in felicity<br>
and static electricity.<br>
We celebrated the celebration<br>
a moment of college matrimony

No, you would not remember and just say no and look at me funny

it's been so long;<br>
you thought you were above me<br>back then.<br>

I loved you, though, in the brief moments we felt<br>
before you brushed me off

<br>
No, I can't say that, filter it out
<br><br>
..
<br><br>
but now the eyes, the beautiful brown eyes stare<br>
longingly, lovingly, waiting crestfallen,<br>
I notice you drop with disinterest, with sadness;

and offer a stock question.

In transmission the void saps all feeling,<br>
incinerates the inward emotion to emptiness.<br>

Oh, what cities of wonder lost!<br>

what atlantises forever<br>
submerged by the vacuum,<br>
the medium between body and soul.

<br>
the emotionless, stock question,<br>
the straight face, the robotic delivery<br>
inspires nothing.
<br><br>
you answer as best you can;<br>
nothing begets nothing.
<br><br>
and silence

<br><br>
what to say

<br>
looks forward focusing blankly<br>
wheels spinning

what to say

brow furrowed, breathing intently

your eyes look so sad, and say:
<br><br><br><br>
please<br>
help me,<br><br>
please say something

<br>
<br>
<br>
the mind's chamber breaks,
<br>
the void crushes the delicate casing; sucking it in<br>
substance rushing out, soul rushing out
<br>
<br>
each thought gripping tightly, futilly,<br>
like the last fingers to the remnants of the<br>
collapsing structure
<br>
before the black hole yanks them
<br>
before the void suffocates the soul
<br>
<br>
drains all cognition

<br>
<br>
<br>
I look forward empty,

stupidly

<br>
please say something
