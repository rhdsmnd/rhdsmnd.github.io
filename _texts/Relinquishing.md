&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's interesting how men find comfort in taking things for granted and women get tired of things they feel they can take for granted[*](#footnote).  Men rely on things; they rely on others.  Women get bored of the same, and once they tire of something and its predictable tendencies, their imagination seeks excitement and interest elsewhere.  This conflict can manifest, perhaps specifically manifests, in the most jarring of realizations, of epiphanies tantamount to Lear's.  After a period of time and vetting, the man places his utmost trust in his most beloved possession, and has constructed, in the case of a woman, a limited conception or model of her.  This construction is incredibly variable with respect to her true nature, and almost hopelessly vain compared to that of the true creator's, though I find it instinctively endearing for them to playfully try on, like one of her outfits, the image and place we have made for her.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously, as mentioned above, she gets bored of our dress just as soon as we find comfort and stability in it.  Right when she has won, as we the judge have decided, so we perhaps might lose her.  I think to some extent men have a natural desire to own things, and women have a natural desire to be owned (though god forbid they mention it publicly in today's society), taken care of, and belonged to someone or placed bearing responsibility in some social structure.  But equally intoxicating for anyone -- like destroying a deteriorating Jenga structure so you can build a new one -- is to reclaim one's control and release oneself from existing, monotonous responsibility in order to pursue some new, shiny object or endeavor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a maturity of mind and masculinity, like Beowulf who found himself without his sword in his greatest battle (his technology, his most prized and valuable possession), to both recognize and relinquish our apparent possessions when necessary, to resist the corrupting desire to control, and to continue onward, to triumph, irregardless of what we may have lost.  Like any great and fundamental human struggle, it is always cyclical, always reoccurring, and as a hero has to continually beat back all varieties of monsters, demons, and foes, so we must vigilantly and constantly discover and relinquish these possessions and this desire: to step back, breathe deeply, and work out these reincarnations as we grow through life, just like we work out so many odd knots in our muscles after we have exerted them.
