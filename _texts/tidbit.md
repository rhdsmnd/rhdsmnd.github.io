Eat?  Eat?  Eating does not matter, what importance is that when compared with his work.  His Work!   His unknown, ungraceful, ugly insignificant work!  How the gap must be bridged, it must be bridged.  Ah the words emit themselves so inconsistently, here a load is dumped, then nothing for a period, then another gush.  Never enough for a completed work.   Fie, fie fie!  Ah, don't go down that rabbithole again  
<br>
Fast.  If you think you are 'hungry' fast, then.  It is healthy.  Be like a healthy Indian and fast.  Don't bother me about eating and other such silly nonsense again.
