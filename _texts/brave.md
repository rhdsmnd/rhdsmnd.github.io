I guess I just feel vulnerable because I've never opened up to anyone, let alone what seems like everyone.  Everything seems like an appearance for something else, rather than the real thing.  Pictures with Instagram filters of girls' butts, bikinis, and the same two friends together, each making half of a heart with their hands.  This causes me a lot of stress because it feels like I can't really be me; everyone seems to have their box well then what is the Ron Desmond box?  What is that Instagram girl's box?  Damn, the hottie on the left has a fat ass.  Does anyone truly understand anyone else in this world? Or do we have to hold inside our struggle, our inner insecurities, and only show others how much we laugh, love, and live?  In chasing the next hashtag maybe we lose a bit of ourselves, a little piece of our soul, a brief opportunity in our short life to open up and tell the world who we really are.  #OnTheInside<br>

Well, I'm tired of holding all my feelings inside.  As a Man, I am told by everyone -- mainly my Dad who I still love in my own way -- that it is not okay to show your emotions.  Why am I not allowed to cry?  Am I not a person?  Do people not cry from time to time?  I've realized that my whole life I have been living someone else's life and it is time to make a change for once and live for myself.  Am I not a Man because I want to wear pink?  Am I not a man for trying to express myself and connect with others?  What if I want to wear a pink tutu and dance in the streets and share pure, spiritual love with everyone?  MAGA.  I'm finally ready to not be what everyone else wants, to finally break free from what society says.<br>

If you are feeling the same way I would love nothing more than for you to share your experiences below.  We are all beautiful, we are all brave, we are all different and unique in our own way. <3
